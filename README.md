# Information Retrieval
Data and code for the paper "Multimode optical fiber transmission with a deep learning network" published in Nature Light Science and applications. (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-018-0074-1).



# Software-requirements
The neural network (NN) training has been implemented via a python-based costume script using Tensorflow installed on Windows 10 OS. Any stable version of tensorflow (strictly below 2.0) and python 3 can be used (Tensorflow version 1.5 running on Python version 3.5.4). 


# Hardware-requirements
The machine used to run the simulations is a windows-based computer with Intel (R) Xeon (R) CPU E5-2609 v3@ 1.9GHz and 32 GB of RAM. We used NVIDIA Quadro M4000 graphic processing unit (GPU) as the platform for running Tensorflow.
